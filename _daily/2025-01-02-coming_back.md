I'm back from winter holidays. I think I setup a good set of goals for the new year and am happy about it.

### Simulations

Over the holidays the simulations didn't run as expected for multiple reasons (mostly I made too many files). I'm going to have them work over the weekend and it will be great.

### Reading

Now that I'm back I think I'm going to be reading an article a day (or at least read + take notes for one hour). I think I'm going to add my notes to the daily posts and maybe that makes them a bit more interesting.
