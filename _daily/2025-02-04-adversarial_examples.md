### Adversarial Examples for Automated Interpretability

We are working on adding adversarial examples to automated interpretability. We have 3 different types ways to get them, but all depend on using "neighbouring" latents. One uses the encoder directions, one uses the correlations between pre-activations and one uses the co-occurence.

### Open Problems in Interpretability

Am reading the paper. Should have a post on the problems I think I would like to work on, ideas to tackle them, and other ideas by the end of week.

### SAEs interpretation of random models

We couldn't replicate the results on SmaLLM with SAES on the MLP. Trying now on the residual stream.
