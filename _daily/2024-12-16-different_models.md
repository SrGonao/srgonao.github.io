### SAE Alignment
Clear sign that increasing the k in top-k decreased alignment between seeds.

GPT2 saes are more aligned than pythia. Waiting for the results on smollm. Will also have Llama results by tomorrow.

Really need more results on diferent architectures. 

### Auto-interp
People are thinking about using RL to improve explainer models, wonder if simulation scoring is any getter than detection/fuzzing. Measuring interventions seems hard
