### SAE Alignment

Transcoder is more aligned than SAE but not by much. Because we 0 out the decoder the starting configurantion is closer.

Training for 80B to measure the convergence with training.

Smoll llm and llama have finished training but still haven't looked at the results.

Tomorrow will be doing the feature absorption + splitting benchmarks from SAE benchmark.
