# Intro

I've decided that I wanted to have a daily journal where I write down what I've done during the research day. It will be mostly unstructured, probably not very coherent but will be a good source for more structured outputs.

I will probably be sharing results directly here, some of them probably wrong. Because I'm going to be updating this daily, hopefully this creates a record of things that become less wrong over time.

# Results
