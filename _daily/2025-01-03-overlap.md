### Overlap 

As predicted increasing the number of SAE seeds has a smaller and smaller effect to decrease the number of latents that are not aligned. 

I found that the metric for absorption is much smaller than expected. 

People have suggested that the SAEs have too high of a CE loss, but maybe its because they are on the MLP? Need to check the residual stream SAEs.
